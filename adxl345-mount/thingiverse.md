Mount for the ADXL345 accelerometer: attach to a ribbon cable strain relief with two M3 bolts (I used M3x20, will probably replace them with shorter ones at some point).

Standoffs not mandatory, but will hopefully prevent the nut from touching any components.

Provided stls (they have different distances between the outer holes):
- [Artillery Genius strain relief](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4281143)
  - `genius_adxl.stl`
- [Sidewinder X1 svandru](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4100016)
  - `x1_svandru_adxl.stl`
- [Sidewinder X1 hara74](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3945539)
  - `x1_hara74_adxl.stl`

See [my github](https://github.com/aapalo/3d-printing/tree/main/adxl345-mount) for more info and files (including the `adxl.scad`).
